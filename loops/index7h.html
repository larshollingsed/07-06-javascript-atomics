  <h1>JS Atomics 07H - For More Fizz!</h1>
  
  <h3>Apart from changing your loop headers, what other changes do you need to make for each? Given that you use either loop structure interchangeably, what do the different loop structures seem suited for?</h3>
  <p>The main difference is that with a "for" loop, the placement of the increment is within the parameters of the loop, but a "while" loop doesn't have that built in.  I guess you could forego the built-in capacity with the "for" loop and just code your own increment in, but then it doesn't seem much different that a "while" loop.  The other difference to me is that the "for" lets you put an argument in for something that happens before the loop starts.</p>

  <h3>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h3>
  <p>Capital letters seem to be treated as differently from their lowercase counterparts as any other character.</p>
  
  <h3>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h3>
  <p>I used == but tested with ===.  Both worked exactly the same since we are dealing with comparing two strings.</p>
  
  <h3>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h3>
  <p>It seems like a bad idea to store a password in plain text in a Javascript file because it's sitting right there waiting for someone to right click and see it in the source.</p>

  <h1>JS Atomic 06F</h1>
  
  <h3>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h3>
  <p>Prediction - the else portion of the if-statement comes into play and alerts the user that this isn't a valid triangle.</p>
  <p>Prediction was correct.  In order to provide the user with better information I'm going to add an if-statement at the very top checking for NaN and report to the user that they must use a number.</p>
  
  <h3>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h3>
  <p>Prediction - If any or all of the lengths are 0 then it will trip the else portion of my if-statement and tell the user their triangle is not valid.</p>
  <p>Prediction was correct.  I could add an if-statement to check if any of the sides have been entered as 0 and notify the user.  And I will for the pratice.  But since they actively had to type 0 in (instead of just hitting enter and inputting the default) I would consider this a personal typo by the user and checking for this would be like checking to make sure they meant to type 11 when they typed 11.  You can't babysit everyone all the time.</p>
  
  <h3>What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h3>
  <p>Prediction - once again the math will play out to give the user the non-valid triangle alert.</p>
  <p>Prediction was correct.  Going to add another if-statement to inform the user if they happen to put a negative number in.  I considered combining this with the 0 clause, but in the interest of giving the user as much information as possible (in order to help them troubleshoot where they went wrong) telling them specifically why their entry wasn't valid seems more prudent.</p>

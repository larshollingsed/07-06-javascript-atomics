  <h1>JS Atomic 06F</h1>
  
  <h3>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h3>
  <p>Prediction - the else portion of the if-statement comes into play and alerts the user that this isn't a valid triangle.</p>
  <p>Prediction was correct.  In order to provide the user with better information I'm going to add an if-statement at the very top checking for NaN and report to the user that they must use a number.</p>
  
  <h3>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h3>
  
  
  <h3>What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h3>

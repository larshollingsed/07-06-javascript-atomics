  <h1>JS Atomics 08A - What's the Password?</h1>
  
  <h3>What does this program look like if done with a while loop? With a for loop? Which is better?</h3>
  <p>I think I like the while loop better.  The syntax of the "for" loop allows for a starting condition (useful but not necessary) and something that happens between each loop (not that useful in this case).</p>
  
  
  <h3>Did you use == or ===? Does it matter?</h3>
  <p>I used !=.  I wanted to loop until the user's input was not the same as the password.  !== would be an option as well but it has the idiosyncracy of being lenient when comparing two different types of variables.</p>
